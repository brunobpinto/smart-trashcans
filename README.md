# Smart Trashcans
This project was developed as the final activity for the Internet of Things (IoT) Project class at PUC-Rio, Brazil. It presents a smart waste monitoring system for PUC-Rio’s campus bins. Each device tracks fill levels, cleaning history, and usage peaks, displaying the data on an interactive dashboard with a campus map. The system classifies bins by cleaning urgency using color indicators: green, yellow, and red.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Infrared Distance Sensor (GP2Y0A02YK0F 20–150 cm)
- RFID Reader
- LoRaWAN Modem
- Motion Sensor
- Computer-Type Power Button with LED

### Software Requirements
- Next.js with Typescript
- Prisma
- Tailwind CSS
- NextAuth
- Postgres Database

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It’s important to note that this application is designed to work with a PostgreSQL database. If you’re using a different database, a few minor adjustments will be required for proper functionality.


### 3D Printed Files
All 3D-printed files can be found in the `/3D-FILES` directory.

> [!WARNING]
> While the 3D parts can be printed using various materials, it is recommended to use weather-resistant materials if the device will be installed outdoors. Materials such as PETG, ASA, or ABS are suitable for outdoor exposure, as they can withstand sunlight and moisture. PLA is not recommended, as it degrades quickly under heat and UV light.
